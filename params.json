{"name":"Trouble In Terrorist Town SCAR-20","tagline":"Pre-release","body":"### Welcome \r\nThe SCAR-20 is a semi-automatic sniper which is found in Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I managed to create a version for Trouble In Terrorist Town which is a gamemode for Garrys Mod. The stats are as follows:\r\n\r\n`SWEP.Primary.Recoil      = 1.587`\r\n***\r\n\r\n`SWEP.Primary.Automatic   = false`\r\n***\r\n\r\n`SWEP.Primary.Damage      = 31`\r\n***\r\n\r\n`SWEP.Primary.Cone        = 0.003`\r\n***\r\n\r\n`SWEP.Primary.Ammo        = \"357\"`\r\n***\r\n\r\n`SWEP.Primary.ClipSize    = 20`\r\n***\r\n\r\n`SWEP.Primary.ClipMax     = 40`\r\n***\r\n\r\n`SWEP.Primary.DefaultClip = 40`\r\n***\r\n\r\n`SWEP.Primary.Sound       = Sound( \"scar20_unsil-1.wav\" )`\r\n***\r\n\r\n`SWEP.HeadshotMultiplier  = 4`\r\n\r\n### Downloading\r\nDownloading is as simple as 1, 2, 3.
